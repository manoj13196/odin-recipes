    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Biryani is a tantalizing and aromatic dish that is a staple of Indian cuisine. Itâ€™s a celebration of fragrant basmati rice, succulent pieces of meat (like chicken, lamb, or beef), and a rich blend of spices. Think of saffron, cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, and more, all dancing together in perfect harmony. The meat is marinated to perfection and cooked with the rice, allowing the flavors to meld beautifully. Every bite offers a burst of spices, making it a true feast for the senses. The garnishing of fried onions, boiled eggs, and fresh coriander adds the final touch of elegance.</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Marinate the Meat:</strong> In a bowl, mix meat with yogurt, garlic-ginger paste, green chilies, and biryani spices. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the Rice:</strong> Boil basmati rice with a bay leaf and a few whole spices (like cloves and cardamom) until it's 70% cooked. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Meat: </strong>In a large pot, heat some ghee or oil. Fry sliced onions until golden brown. Add marinated meat and cook until the meat is tender.</li>
            <li><strong>Layering:</strong> In the same pot, start layering: add a layer of partially cooked rice over the meat. Sprinkle fresh herbs (coriander and mint leaves) and a bit of saffron milk.</li>
            <li><strong>Dum Cooking:</strong> Cover the pot with a tight lid or seal with dough. Cook on low heat for about 20-25 minutes to let all the flavors meld together.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Fluff the biryani gently with a fork. Serve hot with raita (yogurt sauce) and enjoy!</li>
